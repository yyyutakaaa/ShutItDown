## ‚ö†Ô∏è Important Security Notice and Risks

This application exposes an HTTP endpoint (`/shutdown`) that triggers an immediate system shutdown when accessed. To mitigate the risk of unauthorized shutdowns, the app now includes support for an **optional 4-digit PIN code**.

**Security Enhancements:**
- If a PIN is configured, shutdown requests must include the correct code.
- PIN validation is enforced both on the local application and web interface.

**Recommended Usage:**
- Use the PIN feature to prevent misuse, especially on shared or open networks.
- Do not expose the endpoint directly to the internet without further protection.
- Consider additional firewall or network-layer security if using this in sensitive environments.
